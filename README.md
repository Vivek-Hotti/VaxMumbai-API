# VaxMumbai-API
An attempt to creating an API covering hospital details of Covid Vaccination centers in and around Mumbai.

The API is deployed on heroku, the link of the same can be found [here](https://vaxmumbaiapi.herokuapp.com/hospitals).

Data can be parsed freely without the need of any type of authentication. This API was built by me for The Mumbai OpenSource Network. Check out who they are [here](https://github.com/The-Mumbai-Opensource-Network)
